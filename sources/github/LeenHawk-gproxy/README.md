# GPROXY

**A high-performance LLM proxy server written in Rust.** Multi-provider,
multi-tenant, with an embedded React console — all in a single static
binary.

## What it does

GPROXY exposes a unified, **OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini compatible** HTTP
surface on top of many upstream LLM providers, and adds the primitives
you need to run it as a shared service:

- **Multi-provider routing** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel AI Gateway,
  Vertex / Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, NVIDIA, Claude Code, Codex,
  Antigravity, and any OpenAI-compatible custom endpoint.
- **Two routing modes** — aggregated `/v1/...` (provider encoded in the
  model name) and scoped `/{provider}/v1/...` (provider in the URL).
- **Same-protocol passthrough** — minimal-parsing fast path when the
  client and upstream speak the same dialect.
- **Cross-protocol translation** — an OpenAI client can route to a
  Claude upstream (and vice versa) through the protocol `transform`
  layer.
- **Multi-tenant auth** — users, API keys, glob model permissions,
  RPM / RPD / token rate limits, and USD-denominated quotas.
- **Claude prompt caching** — server-side `cache_breakpoint` rules and
  magic-string triggers for `anthropic` / `claudecode` channels.
- **Request & message rewrite rules** — JSON-field manipulation on the
  request body, plus regex text substitution on message content.
- **Embedded React console** — built into the binary, mounted at
  `/console`. No separate frontend to deploy.
- **Pluggable storage** — SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL via SeaORM / SQLx,
  with optional XChaCha20-Poly1305 at-rest encryption.
- **Rust SDK** — `gproxy-sdk` re-exports the protocol, routing, and
  provider crates so you can embed the engine into your own service.

## Quick start

**Download from releases if you use a common device and common os!**

```bash
# 1. Build
git clone https://github.com/LeenHawk/gproxy.git
cd gproxy
cargo build -p gproxy --release

# 2. Run with a minimal config
GPROXY_CONFIG=./gproxy.toml ./target/release/gproxy
```

A minimal `gproxy.toml` seed that creates an admin user with wildcard
permissions:

> **Note:** `gproxy.toml` is only read **once**, on first launch when the
> database does not yet exist. After the initial seed, the database
> becomes the single source of truth — subsequent edits to
> `gproxy.toml` are ignored. Manage live configuration through the
> `/console` UI (or the admin API). To re-seed from TOML, delete the
> database file first.

```toml
[global]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8787
dsn = "sqlite://./data/gproxy.db?mode=rwc"
data_dir = "./data"

[[providers]]
name = "openai-main"
channel = "openai"
settings = { base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1" }
credentials = [ { api_key = "sk-your-upstream-key" } ]

[[models]]
provider_name = "openai-main"
model_id = "gpt-4.1-mini"
enabled = true

[[users]]
name = "admin"
password = "change-me"
is_admin = true
enabled = true

[[users.keys]]
api_key = "sk-admin-1"
label = "default"
enabled = true

[[permissions]]
user_name = "admin"
model_pattern = "*"
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8787/console> and log in as `admin`.

## Sending your first request

```bash
# Aggregated endpoint — provider/model prefix in the body
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-admin-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai-main/gpt-4.1-mini",
    "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Hello" } ]
  }'

# Scoped endpoint — provider in the URL, raw upstream model id in the body
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/openai-main/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-admin-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Hello" } ]
  }'
```
