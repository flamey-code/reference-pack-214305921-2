# HTTP API Reference

### Authentication Conventions

- Admin routes accept either a session token from `/login` belonging to a currently enabled admin user, or an API key owned by an admin user.
- User routes under `/user/*` accept a session token from `/login` belonging to any currently enabled user, including admins.
- Provider HTTP routes and Provider WebSocket routes use a user API key.
- Session tokens and API keys may be sent in any of these headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `x-api-key`, or `x-goog-api-key`.
- Regular HTTP routes accept request bodies up to 50 MiB, while file routes accept bodies up to 500 MiB.

| GET | `/v1/responses` | User API Key | Unscoped OpenAI Responses WebSocket; requires `?model=provider/model` or a resolvable model alias. |

### Provider Admin API

These routes do not use the `/admin` prefix, but they still require an admin session token or an API key owned by an admin user.

## Payload Definitions

### Shared JSON Types

Unless noted otherwise, HTTP request and response bodies are JSON.

```ts
type ErrorResponse = {
  error: string;
};

type AckResponse = {
  ok: boolean;
  id?: number;
};

type CountResponse = {
  count: number;
};

type Scope<T> =
  | "All"
  | { Eq: T }
  | { In: T[] };
```

Notes:

- Most query payload fields may be omitted; omission behaves the same as `Scope.All`.
- Timestamp fields backed by `OffsetDateTime` serialize as timestamp strings.
- Byte-array fields such as logged request or response bodies serialize as JSON arrays of numbers.

### Login

```ts
type LoginRequest = {
  username: string;
  password: string;
};

type LoginResponse = {
  user_id: number;
  session_token: string;
  expires_in_secs: number;
  is_admin: boolean;
};
```

#### Config

`POST /admin/config/export-toml` takes no request body and returns TOML text, not JSON. The logical exported document shape is:

```ts
type GproxyToml = {
  global?: {
    host: string;
    port: number;
    proxy?: string | null;
    spoof_emulation: string;
    enable_usage: boolean;
    enable_upstream_log: boolean;
    enable_upstream_log_body: boolean;
    enable_downstream_log: boolean;
    enable_downstream_log_body: boolean;
    dsn: string;
    data_dir: string;
  };
  providers: Array<{
    name: string;
    channel: string;
    settings: Record<string, unknown>;
    credentials: Array<Record<string, unknown>>;
  }>;
  models: Array<{

    model_id: string;
    display_name?: string | null;
    enabled: boolean;
    price_each_call?: number | null;
    price_tiers: PriceTier[];
  }>;
  model_aliases: Array<{
    alias: string;
    provider_name: string;
    model_id: string;
    enabled: boolean;
  }>;
  users: Array<{
    name: string;
    password: string;
    enabled: boolean;
    is_admin: boolean;
    keys: Array<{
      api_key: string;
      label?: string | null;
      enabled: boolean;
    }>;
  }>;

    provider_name?: string | null;
    model_pattern: string;
  }>;
  file_permissions: Array<{
    user_name: string;
    provider_name: string;
  }>;
  rate_limits: Array<{
    user_name: string;
    model_pattern: string;
    rpm?: number | null;
    rpd?: number | null;
    total_tokens?: number | null;
  }>;
  quotas: Array<{
    user_name: string;
    quota: number;
    cost_used: number;
  }>;
};
```

#### Update

```ts
type UpdateCheckResponse = {
  current_version: string;
  latest_version?: string | null;
  update_available: boolean;
  download_url?: string | null;
};

type UpdateParams = {
  tag?: string | null;
};

type UpdatePerformResponse = {
  ok: boolean;
  old_version: string;
  new_version: string;
  message: string;
};
```

- `POST /admin/update/check`: no request body, returns `UpdateCheckResponse`
- `POST /admin/update`: body `UpdateParams`, returns `UpdatePerformResponse`

### User API

```ts
type UserKeyRow = {
  api_key: string;
  label?: string | null;
  enabled: boolean;
};

type GenerateKeyPayload = {
  label?: string | null;
};

type GenerateKeyResponse = {
  ok: true;
  api_key: string;
};

type QuotaResponse = {
  user_id: number;
  quota: number;
  cost_used: number;
  remaining: number;
};
```

- `POST /user/keys/query`: no request body, returns `UserKeyRow[]`
- `POST /user/keys/generate`: body `GenerateKeyPayload`, returns `GenerateKeyResponse`
- `GET /user/quota`: no request body, returns `QuotaResponse`
- `POST /user/usages/query`: body `UsageQuery`, returns `UsageQueryRow[]`; any supplied `user_id` is overwritten with the authenticated session user
- `POST /user/usages/count`: body `UsageQuery`, returns `CountResponse`; any supplied `user_id` is overwritten with the authenticated session user

### Provider HTTP API

Provider proxy routes do not introduce gproxy-specific request wrappers. They accept and return protocol-compatible upstream payloads directly, subject to route normalization, provider resolution, alias resolution, permission checks, and optional protocol translation.

Exact Rust type names for the protocol payloads live in `sdk/gproxy-protocol/README.md`. The main route-to-type mapping is:

| Route family | Request type(s) | Response type(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/messages`, `POST /v1/messages` | `ClaudeCreateMessageRequest` | `ClaudeCreateMessageResponse`, `ClaudeStreamEvent` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/messages/count-tokens`, `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` | `ClaudeCountTokensRequest` | `ClaudeCountTokensResponse` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/chat/completions` | `OpenAiChatCompletionsRequest` | `OpenAiChatCompletionsResponse`, `ChatCompletionChunk` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/responses`, `POST /v1/responses` | `OpenAiCreateResponseRequest` | `OpenAiCreateResponseResponse`, `ResponseStreamEvent` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/responses/input_tokens`, `POST /v1/responses/input_tokens` | `OpenAiCountTokensRequest` | `OpenAiCountTokensResponse` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/responses/compact`, `POST /v1/responses/compact` | `OpenAiCompactRequest` | `OpenAiCompactResponse` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/embeddings`, `POST /v1/embeddings` | `OpenAiEmbeddingsRequest` | `OpenAiEmbeddingsResponse` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/images/generations`, `POST /v1/images/generations` | `OpenAiCreateImageRequest` | `OpenAiCreateImageResponse` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1/images/edits`, `POST /v1/images/edits` | `OpenAiCreateImageEditRequest` | `OpenAiCreateImageEditResponse` |
| `GET /{provider}/v1/models`, `GET /v1/models` | protocol-specific model-list request | protocol-specific model-list response |
| `GET /{provider}/v1/models/{*model_id}`, `GET /v1/models/{*model_id}` | protocol-specific model-get request | protocol-specific model-get response |
| `GET /{provider}/v1beta/models`, `GET /v1beta/models` | `GeminiModelListRequest` | `GeminiModelListResponse` |
| `POST /{provider}/v1beta/{*target}`, `POST /v1beta/{*target}` | Gemini-compatible request body | Gemini-compatible response body |

Additional notes:

- Scoped file routes choose the provider from `{provider}`. Unscoped file routes require the `X-Provider` header.
- File uploads use `multipart/form-data`. Current built-in typed coverage in `gproxy-protocol` is Claude-compatible file upload with a required `file` part and an optional `purpose` part.
- `GET /{provider}/v1/files/{file_id}/content` and `GET /v1/files/{file_id}/content` return raw file bytes.

### Provider WebSocket API

Like the HTTP proxy routes, WebSocket routes speak protocol-native message shapes:

| Route family | Client message types | Server message types |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /{provider}/v1/responses`, `GET /v1/responses` | `OpenAiCreateResponseWebSocketClientMessage` | `OpenAiCreateResponseWebSocketServerMessage` |
| `GET /{provider}/v1beta/models/{*target_live}` | `GeminiBidiGenerateContentClientMessage` | `GeminiBidiGenerateContentServerMessage` |

### Provider Admin API

```ts
type OAuthStartResponse = {
  authorize_url: string;
  state: string;
  redirect_uri?: string | null;
  verification_uri?: string | null;
  user_code?: string | null;
  mode?: string | null;
  scope?: string | null;
  instructions?: string | null;
};

type OAuthCallbackResponse = {
  credential: Record<string, unknown>;
  details: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

- `GET /{provider}/v1/oauth`: query string is forwarded as `Record<string, string>` to the provider channel; returns `OAuthStartResponse`
- `GET /{provider}/v1/oauth/callback`: query string is forwarded as `Record<string, string>`; returns `OAuthCallbackResponse`
- `GET /{provider}/v1/usage`: no stable local schema; returns provider-specific JSON passthrough from the channel implementation
