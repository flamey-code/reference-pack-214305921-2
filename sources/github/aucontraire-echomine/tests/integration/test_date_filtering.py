"""Integration tests for date range filtering in OpenAIAdapter.search().

This module tests end-to-end date filtering with real fixtures to ensure
the date range logic works correctly across the full stack.

Constitution Compliance:
    - Principle III: TDD (tests for existing implementation)
    - Principle VIII: Memory efficiency (streaming with O(1) memory)
