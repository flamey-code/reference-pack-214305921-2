"""T058: Library API Integration Tests.

This test module validates that the echomine library can be imported and used
programmatically by external consumers (e.g., cognivault integration).

Test Strategy:
    - Import all public API items from top-level echomine package
    - Verify adapter instances can be created
    - Verify library methods can be called successfully
    - Verify return types match documented API contracts
    - Verify IDE autocomplete support via type hints

Constitution Compliance:
    - Principle I: Library-First Architecture (all features importable)
    - Principle VI: Strict Typing Mandatory (type hints for IDE support)
    - Principle III: Test-Driven Development (RED phase - tests written first)

Requirements Coverage:
    - FR-001: Library-first design (importable modules)
    - FR-027: ConversationProvider protocol implementation
    - FR-151-154: Generic typing support for multi-provider pattern

Test Execution:
    pytest tests/integration/test_library_api.py -v

Expected State: FAILING (imports will fail until exports added to __init__.py)
