"""Integration tests for snippet extraction in search (FR-021-025).

Tests end-to-end snippet extraction through the OpenAIAdapter.search().

Requirements:
    - FR-021: CLI output includes snippet column
    - FR-022: Snippets ~100 characters with "..."
    - FR-023: Multiple matches show "+N more" indicator
    - FR-024: JSON includes snippet field
    - FR-025: Graceful handling with fallback text
