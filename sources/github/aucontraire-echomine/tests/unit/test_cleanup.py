"""T068: Resource Cleanup Contract Tests.

This test module validates that file handles and other resources are properly
cleaned up in ALL scenarios: normal completion, early termination, and exceptions.

Test Strategy:
    - Verify file handles closed when iteration completes normally
    - Verify file handles closed when iteration breaks early
    - Verify file handles closed when exception raised during iteration
    - Track open file descriptors to detect leaks
    - Test cleanup with context managers and generators

Constitution Compliance:
    - FR-130-133: Resource cleanup guarantees
    - FR-116-119: Iterator lifecycle management
    - Principle III: Test-Driven Development (RED phase)

Requirements Coverage:
    - FR-130: Methods use try/finally for cleanup guarantees
    - FR-131: File handles managed via context managers
    - FR-132: Cleanup occurs in all scenarios (normal, early break, exceptions, GC)
    - FR-133: NO __del__ methods for cleanup

Test Execution:
    pytest tests/unit/test_cleanup.py -v

Expected State: FAILING (imports will fail until exports added to __init__.py)
