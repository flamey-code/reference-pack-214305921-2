"""Performance benchmarks for User Story 1: Search Conversations by Keyword.

Task: T047 - Performance Benchmark - Large File Search
Phase: RED (tests designed to FAIL initially)

This module validates search performance requirements using pytest-benchmark.
Establishes baseline metrics for search latency and memory efficiency.

Test Pyramid Classification: Performance (5% of test suite)
These tests measure and enforce performance constraints for search operations.

Performance Requirements Validated:
- SC-001: Search 1GB file (<30s requirement)
- FR-069: Progress callback frequency (≥100 items)
- FR-444: 10K conversations searchable
- FR-317-326: BM25 computation latency
- Memory efficiency during search (streaming, no pre-indexing)

Measurement Tools:
- pytest-benchmark: Throughput and latency metrics
- tracemalloc: Memory profiling (Python standard library)
- time.perf_counter: High-resolution timing

Fixtures Required:
- large_export_10k.json: 10,000 conversations for search benchmarking
- Generated via tests/fixtures/generate_large_export.py
