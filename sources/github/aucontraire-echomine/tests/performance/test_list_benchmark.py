"""Performance benchmarks for User Story 0: List All Conversations.

Task: T028 - Performance Benchmark - 10K conversation listing
Phase: RED (tests designed to FAIL initially)

This module validates performance requirements using pytest-benchmark.
Establishes baseline metrics for CHK025 (P50, P95, P99) and CHK108 (latency).

Test Pyramid Classification: Performance (5% of test suite)
These tests measure and enforce performance constraints.

Performance Requirements Validated:
- FR-444: Parse 10K conversations in <5 seconds
- FR-069: Progress callback frequency ≥100 items (per CHK135)
- SC-001: Memory usage <1GB on 8GB machines
- CHK025: Establish P50, P95, P99 latency baselines
- CHK108: Latency per operation type (parse, transform, format)

Measurement Tools:
- pytest-benchmark: Throughput and latency metrics
- tracemalloc: Memory profiling (Python standard library)
- time.perf_counter: High-resolution timing

Fixtures Required:
- large_export_10k.json: 10,000 conversations, 50,000 messages (FR-444 baseline)
- Generated via tests/fixtures/generate_large_export.py
