# Tasks: Echomine AI Chat Parser

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ai-chat-parser/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Per the constitution, TDD is MANDATORY - tests MUST be written first and verified to fail before implementation begins.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US0, US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single project structure:
- Source: `src/echomine/`
- Tests: `tests/`
- Specs: `specs/001-ai-chat-parser/`

## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundation) → All user stories can run in parallel
                                       ↓
                              ┌────────┴────┬───────┬───────┬───────┐

                                    Phase 8 (Polish)
```

**Key Insight**: US0 (List) is the foundation that enables discovery. Users first list conversations, then search/export specific ones.

### MVP Scope (Recommended)

**Minimum Viable Product**: User Stories 0 + 1
- Phases 1, 2, 3, 4 (T001-T057)
- Delivers: List conversations + keyword search
- Validates: Core architecture, performance, memory efficiency
- ~57 tasks

**MVP+**: Add User Story 2 (library API)
- Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (T001-T068)
- Enables: cognivault integration
- ~68 tasks

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 2 Parallelization** (Foundation):
```bash
# All model files can be created in parallel
T010, T011, T012, T013 (models)
T018, T019 (exceptions)
T023, T024, T025 (fixtures)
```

**Phase 3 Parallelization** (US0 - List):
```bash
# Tests, parser, CLI components can run in parallel
T026-T028 (tests)
T029-T031 (parser)
T035-T041 (CLI)

# Then sequential integration:
T032-T034 (adapter integration) → T042-T043 (entry point)
```

**Phase 4 Parallelization** (US1 - Search):
```bash
# Tests, search algorithms, formatters can run in parallel
T044-T047 (tests)
T048-T050 (search algorithms)
T052-T057 (CLI)

# Integration happens after foundation
T051 (adapter search method)
```

**Phase 5 Parallelization** (US2 - Library):
```bash
# All tasks can run in parallel (documentation and examples)
T058-T068 (all tasks parallelizable)
```

**Parallel Opportunities**: ~42% of tasks can run in parallel (marked with [P])

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US0**: Run `echomine list conversations.json` and verify all conversations listed with metadata
- **US1**: Run keyword search via CLI, verify results with BM25 scores
- **US2**: Import library, create adapter, verify type hints
- **US3**: Export conversation to markdown, verify formatting
- **US4**: Filter by date range, verify temporal filtering

**TDD Checkpoints**: Every user story has dedicated test tasks that MUST pass before implementation tasks

**Critical Change**: Added User Story 0 (List) as P0 priority - this is the foundational discovery operation that should be implemented FIRST, enabling all other workflows.
