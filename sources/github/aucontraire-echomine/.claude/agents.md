4. **Synthesize Recommendations**: Resolve conflicts, create unified implementation plan
5. **Implement with Guidance**: Follow agent recommendations during implementation
6. **Final Review by Agents**: Quality gates before commit (tests, types, performance)

## Agent Hierarchy & Decision Authority

### Strategic Layer (Constitution & Architecture)
- **software-architect**: Final authority on architecture decisions, constitution compliance
  - Delegates implementation details to domain architects
  - Resolves conflicts between domain experts
  - Ensures multi-agent coordination aligns with principles

### Domain Layer (Specialized Expertise)
- **multi-provider-adapter-architect**: Protocol design authority
- **search-ranking-engineer**: Search algorithm authority
- **streaming-parser-specialist**: Parsing and memory efficiency authority
- **pydantic-data-modeling-expert**: Data model design authority
- **cli-ux-designer**: Terminal UX authority

### Quality Layer (Enforcement & Validation)
- **tdd-test-strategy-engineer**: Test strategy and TDD enforcement
- **python-strict-typing-enforcer**: Type safety enforcement (no exceptions)
- **performance-profiling-specialist**: Performance contract validation

### Operations Layer (Process & Documentation)
- **git-version-control**: Version control operations
- **technical-documentation-specialist**: Documentation

### Conflict Resolution

When agents disagree:
1. **software-architect** reviews constitution principles
2. Architect makes final decision based on:
   - Constitution compliance
   - Long-term maintainability
   - Library-first principle
   - Simplicity vs performance trade-offs

---

## Constitution Principles Reference

All agents must respect these principles:

1. **Library-First Architecture**: CLI wraps library, not vice versa
2. **CLI Interface Contract**: stdout for results, stderr for errors
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written first, must fail before implementation
4. **Observability & Debuggability**: JSON structured logs, contextual fields
5. **Simplicity & YAGNI**: Simplest solution that meets requirements
6. **Strict Typing Mandatory**: mypy --strict compliance, no exceptions
7. **Multi-Provider Adapter Pattern**: Protocol-based, stateless adapters
8. **Memory Efficiency & Streaming**: O(1) memory, streaming for large files

When in doubt, consult `software-architect` for constitution interpretation.
